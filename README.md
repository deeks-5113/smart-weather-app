# Smart Weather App - MCP 🧠🌤️

## Project Overview
The **Smart Weather App** is a React-based web application that combines **natural language processing (OpenAI)** with **real-time weather data (OpenWeatherMap)**.  
Users can ask weather-related questions in plain English, and the AI intelligently responds, using a simulated **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server to fetch specific weather details when required.

This project showcases a practical application of **AI tool-calling**, where an AI model interacts with external APIs to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

## Features
- **Natural Language Queries** – Ask questions like:
  - “What’s the weather in London?”
  - “Is it going to rain in Paris?”
- **AI-Powered Responses** – Uses OpenAI to generate intelligent conversational answers.
- **Real-Time Weather Data** – Fetches current temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Simulated MCP Server** – Demonstrates AI-to-service interactions using a defined protocol.
- **Responsive UI** – Mobile-friendly design with clean CSS styling.
- **Secure API Key Handling** – Uses `.env` to keep API keys out of source control.
